    <h3>Lyrics</h3>
  <p>This hurts like hell
  <br>But I keep telling myself
  <br>It's gonna get better
  <br>But it's taking forever
  <br>I tried to go out
  <br>But every time I leave the house
  <br>Something reminds me
  <br>Of what's now behind me
</p>
<p>
  <br>Everyday I let go
  <br>Just a little bit more
</p>
<p>
  <br>In the end I'm gonna be alright
  <br>But it might take a hundred sleepless nights
  <br>To make the memories of you disappear
  <br>But right now I can't see nothing <span id="font_blue">through</span> these <span id="font_blue" class="font_red">tears</span></span>
                                                                                  <!-- id 와 class 동시 사용시 id 우선!             -->
</p>
<p>
  <br>Control my thoughts
  <br>Convincing myself it's your loss
  <br>I really mean it
  <br>And I'm starting to believe it
</p>
<p>
  <br>'Cause everyday I let go
  <br>Just a little bit more
</p>
<p>
  <br>In the end I'm gonna be alright
  <br>But it might take a hundred sleepless nights
  <br>To make the memories of you disappear
  <br>But right now I can't see nothing <span id="font_blue">through</span> these <span class="font_red">tears</span>
  <br>Out of sight but you're not out of my mind
  <br>So it might take somebody else at night
  <br>To make it feel like you were never here
  <br>But right now I can't see nothing <span id="font_blue">through</span> these <span class="font_red">tears</span>
</p>
<p>
  <br>You said it was over
  <br>But when we got closer
  <br>You cried on my shoulder
  <br>Goodbye
</p>

<p>
  <br>In the end I'm gonna be alright
  <br>But it might take a hundred sleepless nights
  <br>To make the memories of you disappear
</p>

  <br>But right now I can't see nothing <span id="font_blue">through</span> these <span class="font_red">tears</span>
  <br>Out of sight but you're not out of my mind
  <br>So it might take somebody else at night
  <br>To make it feel like you were never here
  <br>But right now I can't see nothing <span id="font_blue">through</span> these <span class="font_red">tears</span>
<p>
  <br>Driving home on an empty highway
  <br>I thought about you and I hit the brakes
  <br>What we had and who we were was so clear
  <br>But right now I can't see nothing <span id="font_blue">through</span> these <span class="font_red">tears</span>
</p>
